## Repository content

### CSV files (data used for main figures)

- **Figure1_Median_PFS_ORR_with_single_agent_TKI_in_cancers_bearing_gene_mutation_of_the_target_RTK.csv**  
  Aggregated efficacy metrics (median progression-free survival and objective response rate)
  for single-agent tyrosine kinase inhibitors in cancers harboring activating alterations of the target RTK.

- **Figure2_Frequency_of_3_classes_of_mutations_in_16_RTK_for_the_17_cancer_types.csv**  
  Frequency of the three main classes of RTK alterations across 16 receptor tyrosine kinases
  and 17 cancer types.

- **Figure3_Expression_of_RTK_in_normal_cells_vs_TKI_activity_in_the_corresponding_cancer.csv**  
  Comparison between RTK expression levels in normal tissues and tyrosine kinase inhibitor
  activity in the corresponding cancer types.

- **Figure4_Function_of_RTK_in_normal_cells_vs_TKI_activity_in_RTK_mutated_cancers.csv**  
  Relationship between RTK physiological function in normal cell lineages and TKI activity
  in cancers harboring RTK alterations.

- **Figure5_The_class_of_RTK_mutations_and_the_functional_role_of_RTK_in_normal_cells_vs_TKI_activity.csv**  
  Integrated analysis linking RTK mutation classes, functional roles in normal tissues,
  and observed TKI activity across cancer types.
